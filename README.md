## how to use

1) Create a `input` file with your input for judge.
2) Create a `output` file with your correct output for judge.
3) Put your code in `template.cpp`

now run `./start.sh` to start the judge and open `result` in a text editor to show the result by the judge and enjoy the hot reload :D
